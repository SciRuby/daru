# Gem Release Policy

Applicable to Daru > 0.1.6

## Versioning

Daru follows semantic versioning whereby the version number is always in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

* Patch bump = Bug fixes
* Minor bump = New features but backwards compatible
* Major bump = API breaking changes

For Major and Minor bumps release candidates should be released around 2 weeks prior to the bump and are indicated by MAJOR.MINOR.0.rc.

For more information see the full semantic versioning specification at http://semver.org/.

## Release Timing

Patch releases should be done after every fix of a major bug (as tagged in the github issue tracker).
Major releases should be kept to the minimum.
