## Installing daru development dependencies

Either nmatrix or rb-gsl are NOT NECESSARY for using daru. They are just required for an optional speed up and for running the test suite.

To install dependencies, execute the following commands:

*  `sudo apt-get update -qq`
*  `sudo apt-get install -y libgsl0-dev r-base r-base-dev`
*  `sudo Rscript -e "install.packages(c('Rserve','irr'),,'http://cran.us.r-project.org')"`
*  `sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev imagemagick`


Then install remaining dependencies:

  `bundle install`

And run the test suite (should be all green with pending tests):

  `bundle exec rspec`

If you have problems installing nmatrix, please consult the [nmatrix installation wiki](https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Installation) or the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sciruby-dev).

While preparing your pull requests, don't forget to check your code with Rubocop:

  `bundle exec rubocop`


## Testing

Daru has automatic testing with Guard. Just execute the following code before you start editting a file and any change you make will trigger the appropriate tests-

```
guard
```

**NOTE**: Please make sure that you place test for your file at the same level and with same itermediatary directories. For example if code file lies in `lib/xyz/abc.rb` then its corresponding test should lie in `spec/xyz/abc_spec.rb`. This is to ensure correct working of Guard.

## Daru internals
